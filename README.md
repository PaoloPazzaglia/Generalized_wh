This folders stores the code implementing the approach of the paper: Pazzaglia, Paolo, Youcheng Sun, and Marco Di Natale. "Generalized weakly hard schedulability analysis for real-time periodic tasks." ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS) 20.1 (2020): 1-26.

The code is based upon and extends the work made by Youcheng Sun and Marco Di Natale in the previous paper "Weakly Hard Schedulability Analysis for Fixed Priority Scheduling of Periodic Real-Time Tasks" ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS) 16 (2017): 1-19

The formulation is coded in C++ and requires CPLEX libraries to run (see https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer)
